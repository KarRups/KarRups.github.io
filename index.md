## about
I have recently finished an integrated Masters at the University of Oxford in Mathematics and Statistics. My thesis was on the use of Self Supervised Learning and Deep Mutual Learning for improving model robustness. 

This summer, I am working at the European Centre for Meidum-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), attempting to use Machine Learning to improve flood inundation prediction.

I want to use my career to improve the wellbeing of people as much as I can. Currently I believe that I can best do this by leveraging my statistical background to improve models in weather prediction, but I have also looked into [Global Health](https://walker.reading.ac.uk/karan-ruparell-visiting-the-walker-institute/) , and am open to projects in this area or any other area I might be a good fit for that also increases the well being of neglected groups.
